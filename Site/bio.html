			Originally from Mission Viejo California, Tom is a comedian whose career is based solely on idiocy and making silly faces. Basically, Tom is an ugly stripper who throws jokes at you instead of clothing (but still wears a thong out of convenience). If failing to make the world smile through comedy, acting or public nudity, Tom promises to deliver rainbows and bunnies to everyone's doorstep. If you do not have a doorstep, Tom Vrab is no longer obligated to supply your happiness and suggests therapy by chocolate. Dark chocolate, you racist. Tom truly loves what he does, thanks God, and enjoys spelling the word 'Diarrhea'. Seriously... ask him to spell it in person. He's got that sh*t on lock. (pun intended)
